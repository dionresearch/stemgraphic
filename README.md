# stemgraphic


# Overview

John Tukeyâ€™s stem-and-leaf plot first appeared in 1970. Although very useful back then, it cannot handle 
more than 300 data points and is completely text-based. Stemgraphic is a very easy to use python package 
providing a solution to these limitations (no size limit, graphical tool). It also supports **categorical**
and **text** as input.

A typical stem_graphic output:

# Installation

Stemgraphic requires docopt, matplotlib and pandas. Optionally, having Scipy installed will give you secondary plots 
and Dask (see requirements_dev.txt for all needed to run all the functional tests) will allow for out of core, big data
visualization. See more python packages that can be installed for more functionality in the section
"Optional Requirements".


Installation is simple:

    pip3 install -U stemgraphic  

or from this cloned repository, in the package root:

    python3 setup.py install
    
If you only have python3, pip3 and python3 are probably going to be pip and python. At this time,
we do not have a conda package yet, but you can install everything else with conda, and then pip install stemgraphic.

# Optional requirements

You can pip install these modules for additional functionality:

- dask (for distributed computing)
- pysixel (for graphics in the text console)
- python-levenshtein (for distance metric)
- scipy (for marginal plots)


# Command line

stemgraphic comes with a command line tool:

    stem -h

    Stem.
    
    Stem and leaf plot from a csv or excel spreadsheet using best defaults. Can do text (text and dot) or graphic (kde,
    graphic, hist, line).
    
    Usage:
        stem <input> [-c <column>] [-d] [-f] [-k <file>] [-o <file>] [-p <percent>] [-r <random>] [-s <server>] [-t <type>] [-u] [-w]
        stem -h | --help
        stem --version
    
    Options:
        -h --help    Show this screen.
        -c <column>  column index
        -d           describe the data
        -f           force dask
        -k <file>    persist sample to file (.csv, .pkl)
        -o <file>    output file (.txt, .png) or stdout
        -p <percent> trim data on both ends (ex: 0.2)
        -r <random>  random_state seed (ex: 42)
        -s <server>  head node for distributed cluster
        -t <type>    alternate type of distribution plot
        -u           use all data (default: 300 on text, 900 on graphics)
        -w           wide format (horizontal)
        --version

A typical command line output:

  ![text heatmap example](https://github.com/dionresearch/stemgraphic/raw/master/png/text_heatmap_in_terminal.png)
    
An example Sixel graphics in the terminal:
