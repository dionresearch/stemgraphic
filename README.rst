stemgraphic
===========

Overview
========

John Tukeyâ€™s stem-and-leaf plot first appeared in 1970. Although very
useful back then, it cannot handle more than 300 data points and is
completely text-based. Stemgraphic is a very easy to use python package
providing a solution to these limitations (no size limit, graphical
tool). It also supports **categorical** and **text** as input.

Installation
============

Stemgraphic requires docopt, matplotlib and pandas. Optionally, having
Scipy installed will give you secondary plots and Dask (see
requirements\_dev.txt for all needed to run all the functional tests)
will allow for out of core, big data visualization. See more python
packages that can be installed for more functionality in the section
"Optional Requirements".

Installation is simple:

::

    pip3 install -U stemgraphic  

or from this cloned repository, in the package root:

::

    python3 setup.py install

If you only have python3, pip3 and python3 are probably going to be pip
and python. At this time, we do not have a conda package yet, but you
can install everything else with conda, and then pip install
stemgraphic.

Optional requirements
=====================

You can pip install these modules for additional functionality:

-  dask (for distributed computing)
-  pysixel (for graphics in the text console)
-  python-levenshtein (for distance metric)
-  scipy (for marginal plots)

Command line
============

stemgraphic comes with a command line tool:

::

    stem -h

    Stem.

    Stem and leaf plot from a csv or excel spreadsheet using best defaults. Can do text (text and dot) or graphic (kde,
    graphic, hist, line).

    Usage:
        stem <input> [-c <column>] [-d] [-f] [-k <file>] [-o <file>] [-p <percent>] [-r <random>] [-s <server>] [-t <type>] [-u] [-w]
        stem -h | --help
        stem --version

    Options:
        -h --help    Show this screen.
        -c <column>  column index
        -d           describe the data
        -f           force dask
        -k <file>    persist sample to file (.csv, .pkl)
        -o <file>    output file (.txt, .png) or stdout
        -p <percent> trim data on both ends (ex: 0.2)
        -r <random>  random_state seed (ex: 42)
        -s <server>  head node for distributed cluster
        -t <type>    alternate type of distribution plot
        -u           use all data (default: 300 on text, 900 on graphics)
        -w           wide format (horizontal)
        --version
