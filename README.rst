stemgraphic
===========

Overview
========

John Tukeyâ€™s stem-and-leaf plot first appeared in 1970. Although very
useful back then, it cannot handle more than 300 data points and is
completely text-based. Stemgraphic is a very easy to use python package
providing a solution to these limitations.

A typical stem\_graphic output:

Installation
============

Stemgraphic requires docopt, matplotlib and pandas. Optionally, having
Scipy installed will give you secondary plots and Dask (see
requirements\_dev.txt for all needed to run all the functional tests)
will allow for out of core, big data visualization.

Installation is simple:

::

    pip3 install -U stemgraphic  

or from this cloned repository, in the package root:

::

    python3 setup.py install

Latest changes
==============

Persist sample from command line tool (-k filename.pkl or -k
filename.csv).

Windows compatible bat file wrapper (stem.bat).

Added full command line access to dask distributed server (-d, -s, use
file in '' when using glob / wildcard).

For operations with dask, performance has been increased by 25% in this
latest release, by doing a compute once of min, max and count all at
once. Count replaces len(x).

Added the companion PDF as it will be presented at PyData Carolinas
2016.

TODO
====

Plenty... but to start:

-  back to back and scale calculation
-  multivariate support
-  provide support for secondary plots with dask
-  automatic dense layout
-  add a way to provide an alternate function to the sampling
-  support for spark rdds and/or sparkling pandas
-  create a bokeh version. Ideally rbokeh too.
-  interactive version based on the above
-  add unit tests
-  add feather, hdf5 etc support, particularly on sample persistence
